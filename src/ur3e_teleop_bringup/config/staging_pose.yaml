    # Pre-teleop staging joint pose for UR3e (radians)
    #
    # Purpose:
    # - Move away from the default upright/straight configuration which may be
    #   near-singular for Cartesian Servoing.
    # - Provide a deterministic, reproducible initial posture before starting
    #   joystick teleoperation.

      - wrist_3_joint
    # A conservative, non-upright “folded” posture that tends to avoid the
    # straight-arm / wrist-aligned singularities at startup.
    # Units: radians. Keep within joint limits; adjust freely later.
    # Conservative “sanity-check” posture for validation:
    # - Only one joint makes a small move; others stay near the initial pose.
    # - Goal: avoid collisions with the default obstacles while verifying the
    #   staging action execution pipeline works end-to-end.
    # NOTE: We'll tune to a better teleop posture later.
